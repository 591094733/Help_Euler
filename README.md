Euler will need to interact with the environment to find someone willing to give him a gold coin.

However, these coins wont go without a fight! (In this case, a puzzle to solve)

Each quest giver may give more than a single coin per correct answer. There are a total of ten coins to collect!

```sh
Some coins are hidden, look carefully and interact with everything!
```
